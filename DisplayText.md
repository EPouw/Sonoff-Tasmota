**DisplayText commands:**

(You must set DisplayMode to zero to use DisplayText, or disable other
modes before compilation with \#undef USE\_DISPLAY\_MODES1TO5), then
select your display with DisplayModel (see list below) dont forget to
select the gpio pins you need.  

DisplayText not only draws Text but via escapes also line primitives  

commands are embedded within brackets \[\]  

p stands for parameter and may be a number from 1 to n digits  

on monochrome graphics displays things are drawn into a local frame  
buffer and send to the display either via the „d" command or
automatically at the end of the command

**remarks on e paper displays:**

epaper displays have 2 operating modes: full update and partial update.
While full update delivers a clean and sharp picture it has the
disadvantage of taking several seconds for the screen update and a
severe flickering during update.
Partial update is quite fast (300 ms) with no flickering but there is
the possiblity that erased content is still slightly visible .
To „whiten" the display it is therefore usefull to „full update" the
display in regular intervals (e.g each hour)

2 types are supported:  
the 2.9 inch partial update display (296x128)  
and the 4.2inch full update display (400x300)  

Defines =\> USE\_SPI , USE\_DISPLAY\_EPAPER29, USE\_DISPLAY\_EPAPER42

To unify the color interface on epaper 1 (white) is actually black and 0
(black) is white.
updating the display does not wait for completion, so after updating you
must wait about 300 ms before the next update cmd.  


**Hardware connections:**  

I2C displays are connected in the usual manner and defined by tasmota
pin selection  
The I2C Adress must be given by DisplayAdress XX e.g. 60 and the Model
set with DisplayModel e.g. 2 (for SSD1306) to permanently turn the
display on set DisplayDimmer 100. Display rotation can be permantly set
by DisplayRotate X (0-3)  
E-paper displays are connected via 3 wire SPI (CS,SCLK,MOSI) the other 3
Interface lines of the display (DC,Reset,busy) may be left unconnected.
The jumper on the circuit board of the display should be set to 3 wire
SPI. You can NOT use GPIO16 for software spi!

**ILI9488 driver**  

This color LCD display (480x320) uses a 3 wire hardware SPI interface. (MOSI=GPIO13, SCLK=GPIO14,CS=GPIO15) the backlight on/off pin must be selected too.
Defines =\> USE\_SPI , USE\_DISPLAY\_ILI9488  

The capacitive touch panel is connected via I2C.  
if you want to use virtual buttons define USE_TOUCH_BUTTONS  

**RA8876 driver**  

This color LCD display (1024x600) uses normal hardware SPI (with MISO) (backlight pin not needed)  
Defines =\> USE\_SPI , USE\_DISPLAY\_RA8876  
font 7 is the build in font and is extremely fast. (size from 1..4 supported)
over all this display is extremely fast because of hardware acceleration.
rotation not yet supported.  
The capacitive touch panel is connected via I2C.  
if you want to use virtual buttons define USE_TOUCH_BUTTONS  
(dimmer supported)  

**SSD1351 driver**  

This OLED color display (128x128) also uses a 3 wire SPI interface. This driver uses hardware SPI (MOSI=GPIO13, SCLK=GPIO14,CS=GPIO15)
(dimmer supported)  

Defines =\> USE\_SPI , USE\_DISPLAY\_SSD1351  

**remarks on OLED displays:**  

oled display modules have an expected lifetime of about 10000 hours (416 days) which means they should not be on permanently. you may use a proximity sensor to turn the display on and off.
dimming the display will also expand the lifetime. (dimming to 50% expands the lifetime to about 25000 hours)  

**remarks on burnin:**  

OLED displays as well as LCD displays are subject to burn in when a static  
content is displayed over a long period of time. therefore they should not be on  
permanently. you may use a proximity sensor to turn the display on and off.  


**remarks on fonts:**  

The EPD fonts contains 95 chars starting from code 32 while the classic
GFX font containts 256 chars ranging from 0 to 255.  
To display chars above code 127 you must specify an escape sequence
(standard octal escapes dont work here) the \~character followed by a
hex byte can define any character code. So custom characters above 127
can be displayed  

**remarks on heap usage:**

the epaper and b/w oled displays use a frame buffer within heap memory which consumes x*y/8 bytes. (e.g. 15 kb on the 400x600 epaper)
the color lcd and the color OLED do not hold frame buffers in heap  

**examples:**

// print Text at line  
// size 1 on line 1, column 1  
DisplayText \[s1l1c1\]Hallo how are you?  

// draw a rectangle and draw text inside with size2 and 7 chars padded
with spaces  
DisplayText \[x85y95h130v30h-130v-30s2p7x90y100\]37.25 C

// clear screen  
DisplayText \[z\]

// draw rectangle from x,y with width and height  
DisplayText \[x50y50r200:100\]

**remarks to display drivers:**

Waveshare has 2 kinds of display controllers: with partial update and
without partial update. The 2.9 inch driver is for partial update and
should support also other waveshare partial update models with modified
WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters

The 4.2 inch driver is a hack which makes the full update display behave
like a partial update and should probably work with other full update
displays.

the drivers are subclasses of GFX library  
the class hirarchie is LOWLEVEL :: Paint :: Renderer :: GFX  
modified (some more functions declared virtual for acceleration) GFX library    
Renderer: the interface for Tasmota  
Paint: the modified pixel driver for epaper  
there are several virtual functions that can be subclassed down to
LOWLEVEL.

The display dispatcher only does the class init call  
All other calls go to the Renderer class  
In black and white displays a local ram buffer must be allocated before
calling the driver  
This must be set to zero on character or TFT color displays.  

The GFX proportional fonts can alternativly be used instead of the EPD
fonts by selecting the fonts with \#define in the renderer driver file.

only 1 SPI Display driver \#define is allowed at a time  


**Remark for the 400x300 epaper:**

This display requires 15k RAM which only fits when using the 2.42
Arduino library because this lib leaves much more free ram than previous
versions. epd fonts use about 9k flash space. Can be ifdefd  

SSD1306 = 1,15 k  
SH1106 = 1,18 k  
EPD42 = 2,57 k  
EPD29 = 2,1 k  
ILI9488 = 7,3 k  
SSD1351 = 1,7 k  

Display and Renderer class about 12 k
